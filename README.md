# Ices

Ices are contained formats that simplifies distribution and installation for CometJS. The better part is that they are also used for builds, modules, apis, components and CometJS plugins. 

## Get Started
npm install and save as devDependency:
```sh 
# Save ices to PATH and JSON - Currently 0.1.0
 npm install ices --save-dev
```
Install and remove builds and plugins using ```ices install``` and ```ices remove```.
```sh
# Installation
 ices install build-name 
# Remove
 ices remove build-name
```
Done! Your builds and plugins are successfully installed to the PATH of your choice. Add it to your repository!

## Dotfile
Add the dotfile to your repo: ```.ices``` Ices handles your repository, whenever you install a build, all the packages and plugins are inset into the dotfile. Check out the wiki to learn the commands!
